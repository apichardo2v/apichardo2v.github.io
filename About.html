     Hello everyone! My name is Angel Pichardo and I am a Freshmen at The University of Rhode Island. I'm originally from the Dominican Republic, but I am currently living
         Providence Rhode Island. I am currently majoring in computer science which has always been my passion ever since I once tried to "fix" my dad's computer as a kid
         but that backfired and made it worse. I want to concentrate in cybersecurity because I always wanted to be a hacker, but since hacking is illegal I would love
         to prevent hackings and scamming. My main and only hobby at the is videogames. I mainly play things like Call of Duty and Rainbow Six Siege. I have a strong passion
         for cars, specially Mustangs. I hope that in the future, I am able to own a New Edge Mustang and do a custom build on it inspired from my Uncle's Mustang which was what
         got me to love these cars.
