   <center>   <h1> Welcome to my CSC 106 Final Project! </h1> <br>
    

<center><p>For our project, my partner and I decided to make a sidescroller game very similar to the popular game doodle jump, but it is slightly better. 
Our program has more improvements over the original game in which it was inspired. To play it is very easy and you only need to use two buttons on your keyboard, 
“A” for moving left and “D” for moving right. Don’t forget to land on the platforms and that is why in our game, you have the ability to move from side to side by 
walking off to the left or right of the screen. Doing this just teleports the character to the other side of the screen so that the user is able to reach the platforms 
that might be too far off a jump. Another feature implemented in our program is the lives. Since we made it harder for the user, meaning no double stepping on platforms, 
we added two lives at the bottom. Every time you hit the platform at the bottom you get a speed boost that helps you get higher and helps you reach the platform that you missed.</p></center>
