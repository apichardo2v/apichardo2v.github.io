      <p> 
          Hello Cyberworld! Welcome to my website in which my most recent programming projects will be posted.<br> 
          This website is a work progress meaning that it will get better and better. As of for my projects, <br>
          I will be posting things from some Javascripts to even publishing apps!<br>
          I personally find joy in programming, specially when the codes are working but I promise that I will make sure<br>
          everything works before it is posted on the website. I am also open to feedback so if you like you can reach out to me <br>
          if you feel like there is something that is not working properly or just if you want to help make it better. Im always available<br>
          at <a target= "_blank" href="https://mail.google.com/mail">anglp2002@uri.edu</a>. Feel free to reach me out! As of now, enjoy my website<br>
          and my most recent pieces of art!
